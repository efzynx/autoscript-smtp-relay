Fix email sending issue by correcting mail command usage

- Fixed the send_test_email API endpoint to use sendmail directly instead of incorrectly using the -a flag with the mail command
- The -a flag was being misused to set From header, causing attachment errors
- Implemented secure email sending with proper headers using temporary files
- Updated .gitignore to properly exclude sensitive config files containing credentials
