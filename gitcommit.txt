Fix email sending issue, add automatic port selection, and improve main menu

- Fixed the send_test_email API endpoint to use sendmail directly instead of incorrectly using the -a flag with the mail command
- The -a flag was being misused to set From header, causing attachment errors
- Implemented secure email sending with proper headers using temporary files
- Updated .gitignore to properly exclude sensitive config files containing credentials
- Added automatic port selection functionality (8001-8999) to avoid port conflicts
- Created run_server.py script to automatically find and use available ports
- Created port_selector.py utility for finding available ports
- Updated main_menu.py to use automatic port selection and check for uvicorn availability
